 * \brief Implements a linear saturation-capillary pressure relation
 *
 * The entry pressure is reached at \f$\overline S_w = 1\f$, the maximum
 * capillary pressure is observed at \f$\overline S_w = 0\f$.
 *
 * It may seem strange to regularize a linear material, here comes the rationale:
 *
 * The relative permeabilities are 0 or 1 outside of the range of effective saturation.
 * However, the transition between the linearly changing and the constant part is not smooth but with a kink.
 * The Newton scheme does not like that. Therefore a smooth transition is accomplished by interpolating these
 * regions with a spline.
 *
 * An example of the regularization of the relative permeability is shown below:
