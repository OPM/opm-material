 * \brief Implementation of the regularized Brooks-Corey capillary
 *        pressure / relative permeability <-> saturation relation.
 *
 * This class bundles the "raw" curves as static members and doesn't
 * concern itself converting absolute to effective saturations and
 * vice versa.
 *
 * In order to avoid very steep gradients the marginal values are
 * "regularized".  This means that in stead of following the curve of
 * the material law in these regions, some linear approximation is
 * used.  Doing this is not worse than following the material
 * law. E.g. for very low wetting phase values the material laws
 * predict infinite values for \f$p_c\f$ which is completely
 * unphysical. In case of very high wetting phase saturations the
 * difference between regularized and "pure" material law is not big.
 *
 * Regularizing has the additional benefit of being numerically
 * friendly: Newton's method does not like infinite gradients.
 *
 * The implementation is accomplished as follows:
 * - check whether we are in the range of regularization
 *   - yes: use the regularization
 *   - no: forward to the standard material law.

     * \brief A regularized Brooks-Corey capillary pressure-saturation
     *        curve.
     *
     * This is a regularized variant of the Brooks-Corey curve. For
     * wetting phase saturations between a lower threshold saturation
     * and \f$S_w=1\f$, for other wetting phase saturations it is
     * regularized in a way which removes the singularity at
     * \f$S_w=0\f$, avoids kinks and allows the capillary pressure to
     * reach arbitrary values. (Albeit, to reach a given capillary
     * pressure, the saturations can become unphysical). The
     * regularization is done in the following way:
     *
     * - For wetting phase saturations lower than the threshold
     *   saturation, the \f$p_c(S_w)\f$ curve is extrapolated using a
     *   straight line exhibiting the slope unregularized capillary
     *   pressure curve at the threshold saturation.
     * - For wetting phase saturations larger than 1, the Brooks-Corey
     *   curve is extrapolated using a straight line that exhibits the
     *   slope of the unregularized Brooks-Corey curve at \f$S_w =
     *   1\f$
