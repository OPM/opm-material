 *
 * \brief This material law takes a material law defined for effective
 *        saturations and converts it to a material law defined on absolute
 *        saturations.
 *
 * The idea: "material laws" (like VanGenuchten or BrooksCorey) are
 * defined for effective saturations.  The numeric calculations
 * however are performed with absolute saturations. The EffToAbsLaw
 * class gets the "material laws" actually used as well as the
 * corresponding parameter container as template arguments.
 *
 * Subsequently, the desired function (pc, Sw... ) of the actually
 * used "material laws" are called but with the saturations already
 * converted from absolute to effective.
 *
 * This approach makes sure that in the "material laws" only effective
 * saturations are considered, which makes sense, as these laws only
 * deal with effective saturations. This also allows for changing the
 * calculation of the effective saturations easily, as this is subject
 * of discussion / may be problem specific.
 *
 * Additionally, handing over effective saturations to the "material
 * laws" in stead of them calculating effective saturations prevents
 * accidently "converting twice".
 *
 * This boils down to:
 * - the actual material laws (linear, VanGenuchten...) do not need to
 *   deal with any kind of conversion
 * - the definition of the material law in the spatial parameters is
 *   not really intuitive, but using it is: Hand in values, get back
 *   values, do not deal with conversion.
