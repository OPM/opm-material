# opm-material jenkins build scripts:

**build-opm-material.sh**:
This is a helper script which contains a function for building,
testing and cloning opm-material and its dependencies.

**build.sh**:
This script will build dependencies, then build opm-material and execute its tests.
It is intended for post-merge builds of the master branch.

**build-pr.sh**:
This script will build dependencies, then build opm-material and execute its tests.
It inspects the $ghbPrBuildComment environmental variable to obtain a pull request
to use for ert, opm-common and opm-parser (defaults to master)
and then builds $sha1 of opm-material. It is intended for pre-merge builds of pull requests.

You can optionally specify a given pull request to use for ert, opm-common
and opm-parser through the trigger. The trigger line needs to contain
ert=&lt;pull request number&gt; and/or opm-common=&lt;pull request number&gt;
and/or opm-parser=&lt;pull request number&gt;. op opo9p
