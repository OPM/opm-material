# - Installation macro
#
# Set up installation targets for the binary library. The following
# suffices must be defined for the prefix passed as parameter:
#
# _NAME             Name of the library
# _HEADERS          List of header files to install
# _TARGET           CMake target which builds the library
# _LIBRARY_TYPE     Static or shared library
# _DEBUG            File containing debug symbols
